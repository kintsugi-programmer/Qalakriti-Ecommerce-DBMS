# E-Commerce Project

## Overview

This project is a simple e-commerce application that allows users to browse products, add them to their cart, and place orders. It's a basic implementation aimed at beginners who have a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SQL queries.

## Features

- View products: Users can browse through a list of available products.
- Add to cart: Users can add products to their shopping cart.
- Place orders: Users can place orders for the products in their cart.
- View orders: Users can view their past orders.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Vanilla)
- **Backend**: Python (Flask framework)
- **Database**: MySQL
- **ORM**: SQLAlchemy (optional, for advanced users)

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository**: 
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/ecommerce_project.git
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   - Flask: `pip install Flask`
   - Flask-MySQLdb: `pip install Flask-MySQLdb` (for MySQL database)
   - (Optional) SQLAlchemy: `pip install SQLAlchemy` (for using SQLAlchemy as ORM)

3. **Set up the database**:
   - Create a MySQL database named `ecommerce_db`.
   - Execute the SQL schema script (`schema.sql`) to create the necessary tables.
   - (Optional) Execute the SQL data script (`data.sql`) to insert dummy data into the tables.

4. **Run the application**:
   ```
   python app.py
   ```
   The application should now be running on `http://localhost:5000`.

## Roadmap

If you're new to web development, here's a suggested roadmap to build this project:

1. **HTML & CSS**:
   - Start by designing the layout of your application using HTML and CSS.
   - Create separate pages for product listing, cart, and order confirmation.

2. **JavaScript**:
   - Implement client-side functionality such as adding/removing items from the cart, updating quantities, etc.

3. **Backend (Flask)**:
   - Set up Flask to serve static HTML files and handle API requests.
   - Implement routes for fetching product data, adding items to the cart, and placing orders.

4. **Database (MySQL)**:
   - Design the database schema to store product information, user data, orders, etc.
   - Write SQL queries to create tables, insert data, and retrieve information as needed.

5. **Integration**:
   - Integrate the frontend with the backend by making AJAX requests to fetch data and update the UI dynamically.

6. **Testing & Deployment**:
   - Test the application thoroughly to ensure all features work as expected.
   - Deploy the application to a hosting service (e.g., Heroku, AWS) to make it accessible online.
