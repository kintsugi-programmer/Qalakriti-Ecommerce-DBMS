Deadline II: Design of Conceptual Model of Your Project and Converting It to Relational Mode
Certainly! Let's consider a more detailed and complex real-life RDBMS design for Qalakriti, an e-commerce platform focusing on handcrafted treasures from various regions of India.

### Conceptual Model:

1. **Entities:**
   - **User:**
     - Attributes: UserID (Primary Key), Username, Email, Password, UserType (Admin/Craftsman/Buyer), RegistrationDate
   - **Address:**
     - Attributes: AddressID (Primary Key), UserID (Foreign Key), Street, City, State, ZipCode
   - **Product:**
     - Attributes: ProductID (Primary Key), ProductName, Description, Price, StockQuantity, CategoryID (Foreign Key), CraftsmanID (Foreign Key), CreationDate
   - **Category:**
     - Attributes: CategoryID (Primary Key), CategoryName
   - **Craftsman:**
     - Attributes: CraftsmanID (Primary Key), CraftsmanName, ContactInfo, BusinessType
   - **Order:**
     - Attributes: OrderID (Primary Key), UserID (Foreign Key), OrderDate, TotalAmount, Status
   - **OrderItem:**
     - Attributes: OrderItemID (Primary Key), OrderID (Foreign Key), ProductID (Foreign Key), Quantity, Subtotal
   - **Review:**
     - Attributes: ReviewID (Primary Key), UserID (Foreign Key), ProductID (Foreign Key), Rating, Comment, ReviewDate

2. **Relationships:**
   - **User-Address Relationship:**
     - One user can have multiple addresses. (One-to-Many)
   - **Craftsman-Product Relationship:**
     - One craftsman can produce multiple products. (One-to-Many)
   - **User-Order Relationship:**
     - One user can place multiple orders. (One-to-Many)
   - **Product-Category Relationship:**
     - One product belongs to one category, but one category can have multiple products. (Many-to-One)
   - **Order-OrderItem Relationship:**
     - One order can have multiple order items, and one order item belongs to one order. (One-to-Many)
   - **Review-Product Relationship:**
     - One product can have multiple reviews, but one review is for one product. (One-to-Many)

### Relational Model:

1. **User Table:**
   - UserID (Primary Key)
   - Username
   - Email
   - Password
   - UserType
   - RegistrationDate

2. **Address Table:**
   - AddressID (Primary Key)
   - UserID (Foreign Key)
   - Street
   - City
   - State
   - ZipCode

3. **Product Table:**
   - ProductID (Primary Key)
   - ProductName
   - Description
   - Price
   - StockQuantity
   - CategoryID (Foreign Key)
   - CraftsmanID (Foreign Key)
   - CreationDate

4. **Category Table:**
   - CategoryID (Primary Key)
   - CategoryName

5. **Craftsman Table:**
   - CraftsmanID (Primary Key)
   - CraftsmanName
   - ContactInfo
   - BusinessType

6. **Order Table:**
   - OrderID (Primary Key)
   - UserID (Foreign Key)
   - OrderDate
   - TotalAmount
   - Status

7. **OrderItem Table:**
   - OrderItemID (Primary Key)
   - OrderID (Foreign Key)
   - ProductID (Foreign Key)
   - Quantity
   - Subtotal

8. **Review Table:**
   - ReviewID (Primary Key)
   - UserID (Foreign Key)
   - ProductID (Foreign Key)
   - Rating
   - Comment
   - ReviewDate


This extended model includes more attributes such as address details for users, stock quantity for products, and creation dates for both products and reviews. It also maintains relationships between users and addresses, craftsmen and products, and users and reviews. The inclusion of timestamps (e.g., CreationDate, ReviewDate) adds temporal aspects to the model. This complex model is designed to capture various aspects of a real-life e-commerce platform like Qalakriti.

Gpt ideas
Distict features
Certainly! To make the RDBMS project for an online retail store more unique, you can introduce specific features and optimizations in the database design. Here are some project-based ideas:

1. **Real-Time Inventory Management:**
   - Implement a robust inventory management system that provides real-time updates on product availability, helping prevent overselling and ensuring accurate stock levels.

2. **Dynamic Pricing:**
   - Integrate a dynamic pricing model that adjusts product prices based on factors such as demand, supply, and customer behavior. This can be achieved by maintaining historical pricing data and applying algorithms for dynamic pricing.

3. **Multi-Vendor Marketplace:**
   - Extend the database schema to support a multi-vendor marketplace, allowing various vendors to manage their product listings, inventory, and order fulfillment independently.

4. **Localized Warehousing:**
   - Optimize the database to support localized warehousing. This involves tracking inventory in different warehouses, allowing for efficient order fulfillment based on the customer's location.

5. **Predictive Analytics for Trends:**
   - Implement a data analytics component that analyzes customer behavior, purchase patterns, and market trends to provide insights into future product demands. This can help in planning inventory and marketing strategies.

6. **Fraud Detection and Prevention:**
   - Enhance security features by integrating fraud detection algorithms and monitoring suspicious activities to prevent fraudulent transactions.

7. **Supply Chain Integration:**
   - Connect the database with external systems to facilitate supply chain integration. This involves tracking the movement of products from manufacturers to warehouses to customers.

8. **Augmented Reality Product Visualization:**
   - If applicable, extend the database to support augmented reality features, allowing customers to visualize products in their real-world environment before making a purchase.

9. **Intelligent Search and Filters:**
   - Improve the search functionality by incorporating intelligent algorithms for product recommendations, auto-corrections, and advanced filtering options to enhance the user experience.

10. **Cross-Channel Consistency:**
    - Ensure consistency across various sales channels, including online platforms, mobile apps, and brick-and-mortar stores, by implementing a centralized database management system.

11. **Customer Loyalty Program:**
    - Design a loyalty program within the database, tracking customer purchases and rewarding them with points, discounts, or exclusive offers to encourage repeat business.

12. **Mobile-First Approach:**
    - Optimize the database and application design for mobile devices to provide a seamless and user-friendly shopping experience on smartphones and tablets.

Remember to adapt these suggestions based on the specific requirements and constraints of your online retail store project.

Covid Vaccine Management System project example – business requirement (Mid-sem W22)

The GoI plans to build a DB for managing the information about procurement, distribution of vaccines and booking of
appointments in hospitals. The dept procures vaccines from various vendors and then distributes them to local health
centers for vaccinations to citizens. A citizen books an appointment in a hospital for vaccination.

A citizen may choose the vaccination type (Covishield/Covaxin) and whether it is their first, second or booster shot [based on
their vaccination status] while booking an appointment in a hospital. The citizen also chooses the date, time slot and a
hospital (Hid, Hname, Hlocation, License number) they want to get vaccinated at. While booking an appointment, a citizen is
required to give all personal information including Aadhaar number, name, date of birth, city, and a phone number. It may
happen that some citizens may not appear on their scheduled appointment date/time. In this case, they need to rebook and
get fresh appointments. Your database design should register the information whether a citizen appeared at the scheduled
appointment date/time, and the current vaccination status of a citizen. The system calculates the age based on DOB and
categorizes citizens as teenagers, adults and senior citizens for analysis. Only double vaccinated people in the third category
can opt for a booster shot while the teenagers are not eligible for vaccination. Citizens may book vaccination appointments
for multiple people.

Since there are a sufficient number of vaccines in hospitals, CMO would like to get the status of vaccine inventory and how
many folks are covered in their health center each day. If the inventory falls below a certain threshold, the CMO office will
send a fresh order for the next supply. To make sure a citizen gets an appointment, the health center checks whether
appointments are available before booking the appointment and updates the DB once the citizen gets an appointment.

Vendors must register on the portal to sell vaccines to the GoI by entering details about the vendor, their organisation,
details of type and number of vaccines available for sale, and vaccine price quotation. They must also upload a document to
prove that they are authorized to sell vaccines. The GoI advertises for vendors via digital and print media.

Vaccine requests by hospitals and applications from vendors are approved by GoI officials. The costs of vaccines sold by GoI
to health centers and by health centers to the citizens are fixed. However, the GoI may have a mutual negotiation with
vendors for different bulk rates. All information about the sale of vaccines to hospitals and procurement of vaccines from
vendors is stored in the system.

Sangeet Talents Management System – business requirements (Mid-semW21)
highly popular ‘McM Sangeet company’ plans to organize a competition for searching the right talents to train them
for creating music albums. The company advertises their recruitment requirements on different channels (both print and
digital media) for inviting talents by submitting their personal information, prior experience, and a 2-5 minutes media
file, which is of either an audio file (for songs) or a video (for songs and/or playing music instruments), to a given URL in
the advertisement. The company writes in the advertisement that the shortlisted candidate will be informed by Phone
and/or Email.

A candidate can submit more than one entry and has an option to provide more than one phone number in the
submission, which are unique to him/her.

After the closing date of entry submission, a panel evaluates all entries and recommends a set of candidates to invite
them for the next round. The company maintains the information about the panellist (personal information, industry
experience, association with the McM company). A candidate can see the outcome of their application online.

These shortlisted candidates are then invited to perform a ‘Live’ show in Mumbai and finally top ‘n’ candidates are
selected in each album category (i.e. audio and video). These 2n candidates are called as the member of McM-2020.

Different music groups (pop, classic, leisure, evergreen, …) are formed to create the music albums (audio/video). Every
member belongs to one or more music group which is moderated by a director who himself/herself is a member of the
group. Each member has a different role to play in each album.

Once the album is created and approved by McM Director, its trailer is released online for limited time to the outsiders
to give their comments (like and dislike), and all this recorded in the database (album name, date of release, number of
visits, number of likes/dislikes, …).

The McM decides the price of the album after analysing the data collected from its trailer release, and then the album is
released to distributors who eventually will sell it online. Note, each distributor may be charged a different price per unit
depending on the negotiation between the McM and distributor.

When a distributor sells an album, the download request comes to the McM site. Thus, the McM company maintains the
record for each download (Incoming URL – identifying the distributor, Album#, Date, Download Status – success/failure)
so that they can track the number of downloads for raising the invoice.
